My portfolio
It is very basic website made my me to test my proficiency in HTML and CSS.
The website layout consists of Navbar in *vertical direction*, Landing page and Footer.
I have used *Bootstrap framework* for CSS with some of my own customization to fonts and background colour.
The whole website is in progress, I may made changes based on what suits my taste to my background colour, fonts, profile picture, etc.
I am going to add other pages to my website like About, Contact, etc. page to make use out of my vertical Navbar to navigate my webpage.

The project is inspire my some of the tutorials available on YouTube.
